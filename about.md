# About Danfe
**`Dynamic Assembler for Native Function Engine`** <br>
<br>
This is a very `loosly typed` intrepreted and soon to be compiled language, designed for building the code to multiple backends. <br>
::: warning Info
Planing on making danfe a `statically typed` language to make it is possible to compile it to `other` statically typed language backends like `(go, rust)`.
:::

It's similar to [Lua](https://www.lua.org/start.html) at it's design. <br>
Danfe is a very simple language. Going through this documentation will take you about an `hour`, and by the end of it you will have pretty much learned the entire language. <br>
<br>
The language promotes writing `simple` and `clear` code with minimal abstraction. <br>
Despite being simple, Danfe gives the developer a lot of `power`. <br>
<br>
Danfe is written in such a way that it is going to be easier to hackup a compiler for other languages in short period of time. Danfe can compile into a human readable code of other languages (for eg: asm, golang, js, vlang, c, python).

::: tip How was it named  `Danfe`

Nepali word: `डाँफे` <br>
Name: `Danfe` pronounced same as `Danphe` aka  `Himalayan monal` is the national bird of the country from where the creator of this language hails (NEPAL). <br> Acronym: `Dynamic Assembler for Native Function Engine`
