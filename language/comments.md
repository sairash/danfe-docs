# Comments
`Comments` are a set of commands that are ignored by `Danfe`. They are used in a scenario where you want to attach a note to your code or a section of code so that when you visit it later, you can recall it easily.

``` danfe
# This is a single line comment
x = 10   # x is defined with value 10
```
Danfe only provides `single line` comments.
